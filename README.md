# OOP - Object Oriented Programming
###### Or Ogres (love) Onion Peeling for the cultured programmers among us!
For this challenge, I have to finish some exercises to learn a bit more about Object Oriented Programming.
I tried working with classes in the past, but it was still a bit too complicated for me.
So I'm really looking forward to this challenge, because OOP is something I really want to learn how to do!

## Exercise 1: "Programming with class(es)."
The hardest part about OOP, in my opinion, is that you need to define everything you do.
````
class Beverage {
    public string $color;
    public int $price = 0;
    public string $temperature = "cold";

    public function __construct(string $color, int $price, string $temperature) {
        $this ->color =$color;
        $this->price = $price;
        $this->temperature = $temperature;
    }
````
It was quite difficult for me to remember to write code this way.
But I do want to keep getting better at this, writing code like this makes a lot more sense (once you understand it though).
And projects can keep getting bigger and bigger without causing a major headache.

## Exercise 2: "Beverage, you ARE the father of lil' softdrinks!"
